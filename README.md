# Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the Visavc project, an advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tool designed to provide an encompassing solution for real-time monitoring, analysis, and profiling of potential threats on the Telegram platform. Our comprehensive set of features, powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence, positions Visavc as a key player in proactive threat intelligence and cybersecurity.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Active Real-Time Telegram Monitoring

Visavc ensures active, real-time monitoring of Telegram channels, staying ahead of emerging threats and potential security risks. This capability is fundamental for maintaining a vigilant stance against evolving cyber threats.

### 2. Processing Messages from Telegram

Leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, Visavc efficiently processes incoming messages from Telegram. The AI algorithms play a crucial role in identifying potential threats, extracting unique usernames, and converting potential threats into the structured and standardized STIX format for thorough analysis.

### 3. Downloading Combo Lists and Stealer Logs

Our system actively downloads combo lists and stealer logs shared in Telegram groups, processing and organizing this data into a structured format within a dedicated database. This approach enables comprehensive and detailed threat analysis.

### 4. Real-Time Retrieval of Invitation Links

Visavc dynamically retrieves temporary private invitation links shared in Telegram groups, providing real-time insights into ongoing activities and enabling swift responses to potential security risks.

### 5. Custom Dashboard Presentation

All the gathered and processed data is presented on a custom dashboard developed by our expert team. This dashboard serves as an intuitive interface, offering users a consolidated view of the threat landscape and facilitating informed decision-making.

## Short-Term Roadmap

### A. Visualizing Data

In the short term, we plan to enhance our system by incorporating advanced data visualization techniques. This will empower users to correlate information effectively among different users or groups, providing a more holistic understanding of the threat landscape.

### B. Automatic Joining of Invitation Links

Automation is key to efficiency. Our short-term plans include the automatic joining of newly obtained invitation links, streamlining the monitoring process and ensuring a swift response to emerging threats.

### C. Creating Target Profiles

To enrich our threat intelligence capabilities, we aim to extend our system to search and match obtained username information on social media and the dark web. This will result in the creation of comprehensive target profiles, enhancing our understanding of potential threats.

### D. Data Analysis

Data analysis is a core component of threat intelligence. Our short-term goals include a focused effort on data analysis, with the aim of generating charts and visual representations that provide deeper insights into the collected data.

## Long-Term Vision

### A. Advanced AI Analysis of Messages

Looking ahead, our long-term vision involves implementing advanced artificial intelligence for the automated analysis of all incoming messages. This will significantly enhance our ability to detect nuanced threats and improve the overall effectiveness of our CTI tool.

### B. Automated Analysis of Telegram Malware

In the long term, we aspire to develop automated analysis for malware shared on Telegram. This initiative will involve generating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), contributing to a proactive and preemptive cybersecurity strategy.

### C. Discord and Dark Web Monitoring

Expanding our monitoring capabilities beyond Telegram, our long-term goals include incorporating Discord channels into our system and extending our reach to activities on the dark web. This expansion will ensure a more comprehensive and holistic approach to threat intelligence.

# Conclusion

The Visavc project is committed to continuous development and improvement, aiming to stay at the forefront of cyber threat intelligence. With a blend of advanced technologies, proactive monitoring, and strategic future plans, Visavc stands as a robust solution in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
